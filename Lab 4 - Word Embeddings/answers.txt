Q1:

The number 243 printed above represents the total number of unique words or entities
 for which word embeddings are available in the 'word_embeddings' dataset.


Q2:

The (300,) printed above represents the dimensionality of the word embeddings for the word 'Spain' in the 'word_embeddings' dataset. 
In this case, the word embedding for 'Spain' is a vector with 300 dimensions.


Predicted Country:
Egypt

Predicted Similarity:
0.7626821994781494

Q3:

Yes


Q4:

Yes, because the similarity is close to 1 means that the words Egypt (country2) and Cairo (city2)
are similar to each other.


Computed Accuracy:
0.9192082407594425

Q5:

Yes


Q6:

the words that appear in similar contexts are closer to each other clustered together.
where this model looks at the context only it does not take into account the meaning of the words.
